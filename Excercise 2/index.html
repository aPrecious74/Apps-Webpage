            <p>ðŸ“œAt the Doherty Robotics Club, students have the option of
                either working alone or in groups to design and
                construct a functional robot according to competition
                criteria and constraints. The competition changes every
                year as a new tournament is presented, giving you the
                opportunity to utilize a variety of equipment.
